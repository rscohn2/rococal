SUMMARY:From Troubled Teens to Tsarnaev: Promises and Perils of Adolescent Neuroscience and Law
DESCRIPTION:The neuroscience of adolescent brain development has had increasing impact on American jurisprudence. SCOTUS relied on it in barring execution for crimes committed as a juvenile and holding that mandatory life without possibility of parole for juveniles is unconstitutional. This panel will examine implications of neuroscience for law in areas including death penalty mitigation for young adults over 18\, as in the Tsarnaev case; trial of youth as adults; and more. The panel will also discuss implications for constitutional jurisprudence\, legal and policy reform\, and trial practice.

SUMMARY:The Mozilla Delphi Cybersecurity Study: Towards a User Centric Cybersecurity Policy Agenda with Camille François\, Josephine Wolff\, Andy Ellis\, and Bruce Schneier
DESCRIPTION:Berkman Tuesday Luncheon Series RSVP required to attend in person Event will be webcast live at 12:00 pm\nJoin us on September 29th for a discussion of the "Mozilla Delphi Cybersecurity 1.0. Study: Towards A User Centric Policy Framework\," presented by lead researcher Camille François with Berkman community members Josephine Wolff\, Andy Ellis\, and Bruce Schneier\, who participated in the study.\nCamille worked for several months with the Mozilla Foundation to orchestrate the study and resulting report. The study used a modified version of the Delphi research technique. More than 30 leading cybersecurity experts from a wide variety of backgrounds – including academia\, civil liberties\, government and military\, security\, and technology – participated in the study. Using a pseudonymous format to encourage candid feedback and open dialogue on the issues\, the study tackles the following questions: what is the role of policy in cybersecurity? How consensual is the definition of cybersecurity? What are the current priorities for cybersecurity policy? Which issues get too little or too much attention? What are measures that a diverse set of cybersecurity actors can agree on as being both feasible and desirable?\nThe study produced a map of priorities\, issues\, and solutions for cybersecurity that highlights consensus and dissensus in the space. Join us to discuss the lessons learned in this process and the report's findings.\nPresented by: Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University\n

SUMMARY:The Marketized Family: A Talk by Professor Maxine Eichner
DESCRIPTION:Market forces are having increasingly negative effects on the health of U.S. families.   In the poor and working classes\, these forces are causing the disappearance of marriage and instability in relationships.  In the middle class\, these forces are leading to a tremendous time crunch and gender inequality.  Overall\, paid work that is largely unrewarding is taking up an increasingly larger chunk of the lives of American families.\nProfessor Eichner contends that a critical role of government is to buffer families from market forces to protect their general wellbeing\, as well as to support their caretaking and human development functions.  By this standard\, the U.S. government is badly failing.  Professor Eichner argues for reordering market regulation to support citizens’ wellbeing; in turn\, this requires regulating markets to support families.

SUMMARY:"Kill all DRM in the world forever\, within a decade" Cory Doctorow
DESCRIPTION:Cory Doctorow wants to kill all DRM in the world forever\, within a decade and as an EFF Special Advisor\, he's working with them to do just that.\nFrom the Electronic Frontiers Foundation:\nDigital Rights Management (DRM) technologies attempt to control what you can and can't do with the media and hardware you've purchased. Corporations claim that DRM is necessary to fight copyright infringement online and keep consumers safe from viruses. But there's no evidence that DRM helps fight either of those. Instead DRM helps big business stifle innovation and competition by making it easy to quash "unauthorized" uses of media and technology. DRM has proliferated thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA)\, which sought to outlaw any attempt to bypass DRM.\nFans shouldn't be treated like criminals\, and companies shouldn't get an automatic veto over user choice and innovation. EFF has led the effort to free the iPhone and other smartphones\, is working to uncover and explain the restrictions around new hardware and software\, has fought for the right to make copies of DVDs\, and sued Sony-BMG for their "rootkit" CD copy-protection scheme.

SUMMARY:Urban Planning and Architectural Design for Sustainable Development (UPADSD)
DESCRIPTION:Development and planning problems continuously affect both rural and urban areas all over the world.\n\nUrban development has led to deterioration of the environment and has also worsened the problems faced by rural areas\, such as mountain regions\, coastal areas and many others. Taking into consideration the interaction between different regions and developing new methodologies for monitoring\, planning and implementation of novel strategies can hinder solutions and lead to environmental pollution and non-sustainable use of available resources.\n\nNowadays\, sustainable development has become an inevitable choice for humanity after facing a series of resource and environmental problems that have become universal problems faced by all countries all over the globe.\n\nThe topic of how to scientifically develop while effectively using the limited environmental resources has become an important topic in academia\, the private sector\, and governmental departments.\n\nIEREK organizes the Urban Planning and Architecture Design for Sustainable Development Conference to exchange the better understanding of the sustainable development between social and economic development with the environmental resources\, exploring the problems between the resources of the environment and sustainable development in the academia\, engineering technology\, management and policy.\n\nThe Urban Planning Conference deals with all aspects of development and planning and brings together scientists and other stakeholders from across the globe to discuss the latest advances in the field\, as well as to seek and highlight developments in managerial strategies and assessment tools for policy and decision makers.

DESCRIPTION:Join us on October 14th at 6:00 PM for a discussion of recent research on young adults from MassINC and the Executive Session on Community Corrections (2013-2016)\, including the inaugural report from a brand-new series 'New Thinking in Community Corrections' which focuses on the latest science and thinking\, written by Executive Session members Vincent Schiraldi\, Bruce Western\, and Kendra Bradner.\n\nOverview\nThe human brain has been clinically shown to not fully mature until we reach our mid-20s. New research envisions a system that extends the reach of the juvenile court to reflect a modern understanding of the transition into adulthood. Approaches could include raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 21\, with additional\, gradually diminishing protections for young adults up to age 24 or 25; age-responsive reforms within adult criminal justice agencies; and community-based supports tailored to this age group.\nMost people who ever have a felony record obtain that record before age 25 and most people who commit a felony 'age out' of criminality by age 25. If young people can reach age 25 without a criminal record and without prison experience\, their likelihood of ever having such a record/experience drops significantly. As the nation grapples with the best way to end mass incarceration\, developing an approach to reducing the penetration of young adults into the criminal justice system is of paramount importance.\n\nEvent Details\n• Register for this event to attend in person or via livestream at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DlfL38cPsV-s3G6uFCShf_nntt8grwwJJL5yAP1Gcoc/viewform\n• Harvard Law School | Ames Courtroom\, Austin Hall | 1515 Massachusetts Ave.\, Cambridge |6:00 PM\n \nPanelists\n• The Honorable Gloria Tan (Moderator)\, Associate Justice\, Middlesex Division\, Massachusetts Juvenile Court\n• Molly Baldwin\, Founder and CEO\, Roca\, Inc.\n• D'Quame Brown\, Current Youth Participant\, Roca\, Inc.\n• Adam Foss\, Assistant District Attorney\, Juvenile Division\, Suffolk County District Attorney's Office\n• Vincent Schiraldi\, Senior Research Fellow\, Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management\, Harvard Kennedy School\n• Wendy Still\, Chief Probation Officer (retired)\, San Francisco Adult Probation \n\nSponsors\nThis event is sponsored by the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management (HKS)\, MassINC.\, The Criminal Justice Program of Study\, Research\, & Advocacy (HLS)\, and the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy (HKS).

SUMMARY:OPIA Q & A on Careers in Indigent Defense with Kristen Nelson
DESCRIPTION:The Wasserstein Fellow Lunch Talk is a unique opportunity for students to learn from\, and network with\, Wasserstein Fellows who have been involved in public service work in a variety of practice settings. Co-sponsored by Criminal Justice Program of Study. Non-pizza lunch will be provided. This event is open to the Harvard community only. Please bring your Harvard ID for admittance to the event. \n\nKristen Nelson ’04 is a Deputy State Public Defender on the Complex Litigation Team for the Office of the Colorado State Public Defender in Denver\, which represents indigent clients at the trial level in complex first-degree murder cases\, including those in which the State is considering or has declared it is seeking the death penalty.  Along with her teammates\, Kristen most recently spent three years representing James Holmes in the Aurora theater shooting case\, which fostered a public dialogue about the issues of mental illness and the death penalty.  As the designated appellate-minded lawyer on the trial team\, Kristen was responsible for developing the legal issues in the case\, drafting and arguing the motions\, interlocutory appeals\, and jury instructions\, and providing legal analysis and input on other strategic decisions in the case.  Prior to moving to Colorado in 2011\, Kristen spent four years as a staff attorney at the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery\, Alabama\, where she spent the majority of her time representing indigent clients in various stages of appeal on Alabama’s death row\, as well as other criminal defendants and prisoners denied fair treatment under the law.  Kristen began her indigent defense career as a trial attorney at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia from 2005-2007 following a clerkship with U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson in the Middle District of Alabama. Kristen received her undergraduate degree in English summa cum laude from Wellesley College in 1999\, an M.Phil in Criminology from Cambridge University in 2000\, and her law degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 2004. She was named a Heyman Fellow in 2005.

DESCRIPTION:Greeting: Marcela Davison Aviles\,  Managing Director\, El Camino Project "Climate Change and the Fall of the Roman Empire". Michael McCormick Drought\, fire\, pestilence and shifting weather patterns? It sounds familiar in 2015. But how about 215? Join us to hear one of the world's premiere historians\, Michael McCormick\, the Francis Goelet Professor of Medieval History\, discuss how changes in weather patterns may have hastened the end of the empire in the West. Then\, picking up precisely where Professor McCormick leaves off\, renowned operatic diva Carla Dirlikov explores the transformation of Latin to Latin America in an inspired half-hour program of vocal magic that bridges two millennia. An intermezzo of specially themed Latin-inspired food & wine links the programs.

SUMMARY:Beyond Tomorrow Conference
DESCRIPTION:Modern civilization has at its core a mission of preservation: it is by its very definition the physical manifestation of the entire human experience\, using the collected expressions of art\, music\, literature and philosophy as a well-font to feed and inform future endeavor. We presume as a matter of course that this knowledge base will continue to be valued and augmented\, and that the core principles of civilization — the rule of law\, the right to enlightenment and self-expression\, the concern for general health and welfare — will continue to guide the march of human progress.\nBut what if…. Not?\nWhat happens when the foundations of modern civilization come under deliberate and determined assault? What happens when certain people or groups attempt to obliterate entire aspects of human endeavor in order to hasten their own view of the world?\nWhat happens to civilization when evil regimes attempt to re-write history\, shifting or killing entire populations? What happens when entire cultural systems are swallowed and destroyed by uncontrolled commercial development? And perhaps most worrisome of all\, what happens when shifting patterns of climate force drastic and deadly changes on entire populations? What happens to modern civilization then? If history is any guide\, it eventually collapses.\nAt Harvard this October 16-18\, we will accept the inevitability of this change\, and begin the process of planning beyond the short term — Beyond Tomorrow. How do we go about selecting what to save and what to lose? How do we harden these elements against assault? How do we increase the odds of our civilization surviving through the dangerous times ahead?

SUMMARY:I.H.L.athon Series
DESCRIPTION:I.H.L.athon —  ˈī -ˈāch -ˈel-ə-ˌthän — Noun. (Neologism.) Definition: An event in which people meet to engage in collaborative research and analysis on international humanitarian law (IHL) and other legal frameworks relating to war. It's like a hackathon—yet one where the focus is not on creating computer programs and applications but rather on international law related to armed conflict. Think Wikipedia edit-a-thon but for the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello. \n\nThis is a new\, untested format for developing research tools and analysis. We invite applications from current HLS students who are eligible to work in the United States. Unfortunately\, we have a limited number of available spots. \n\nLearn more and apply online at < http://pilac.law.harvard.edu/pilac-student-opportunities//ihlathon-participants >.

SUMMARY:Examining Critical Race Theory: Outsider Jurisprudence and HIV/AIDS--a Perspective on Desire and Power
DESCRIPTION:The sentencing in May of a young\, black Missouri man\, Michael Johnson\, to 30 years in prison\, under suspect circumstances and in defiance of thirty years of science\, for exposing sex partners to HIV is troubling\, but it is not unique.  \nPlease join QTPOC\, a new student organization for Queer\, Trans\, People of Color to hear about Professor Shannon Gilreath’s project focusing on educating lawyers and judges about the realities of HIV\, the irrationality (legally) of HIV exposure statutes\, and the constitutional (due process and equal protection) arguments that can be made against them.  \nAt a time when these laws are being wielded in racist and homophobic ways (individuals who are black tend to be prosecuted under these statutes more often and tend to receive longer prison sentences; homosexual intercourse seems also to be targeted with greater moral condemnation and longer prison sentences)\, it is essential that we have the information necessary to challenge them successfully.

SUMMARY:Property law and the blockchain with Berkman Fellow\, Patrick Murck
DESCRIPTION:What kind of assets are created in blockchain markets and how should the law treat them? As the first successful blockchain asset\, a bitcoin has variously been considered a commodity\, currency and personal property by regulatory agencies\, courts and policymakers. This flexible interpretation has created confusion over jurisdictional boundaries and the application of commercial law concepts. Compounding this confusion is the reliance on insufficient analogies used to describe aspects of these systems like "wallets"\, "coins\," and "miners". These abstractions gloss over important nuances in how the bitcoin system actually works\, and creates a hazard for regulators\, policymakers and academics who use these analogies to shape law and policy decisions.\n\nOver the course of this year\, we will explore three primary areas where foundational legal research and explanation is most needed:\n\n* Property Rights in Blockchain Assets\n* Clearing and Settling Asset Transfers on the Blockchain\n* Counter-party Risk From Nodes on a Blockchain Network\n\nIn this talk we will explore the first area of interest and try to unpack the basic property interests one can have in a bitcoin.

SUMMARY:HALA Speaker Series: LGBTQ Rights in Africa
DESCRIPTION:Members of the African LGBT community are becoming more organized and vocal about their rights as world citizens. The response by some African political leaders to their outcry has not been positive. In several countries\, politicians have successfully framed the LGBTQ movement as driven by western ideals that are incompatible with local religions and cultures. \n\nPlease join HALA in a panel discussion exploring the effects of growing international intervention on LGBT rights\, the African response to the LGBT rights movement\, and the hurdles faced by grassroots organizations.\n\nOur Panelists:\nLong Jones Wambere is a prominent Ugandan LGBT activist who was recently granted asylum in Cambridge. He has spent his career supporting queer Ugandans with HIV and is now building a network to support LGBT asylum seekers in the United States.\n\nKasha Jacqueline Nabagesera is a co-founder of the first LGBT-rights organization in Uganda and the founder of the country's first gay bar and first pride parade. She recently won the Alternative Nobel Prize\, or Right Livelihood Award\, and was a grand marshal this year at New York Pride. She will appear via Skype.\n\nBrian Klosterboer ('16) worked as a journalist and Fulbright research fellow in Uganda before law school and is currently writing a book on the Ugandan gay rights movement with Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera.

SUMMARY:Second Annual HLS-UCLA Food Law and Policy Conference:  Drugs\, Animals\, and Food:  Law & Policy of Antibiotics in the Food System
DESCRIPTION:The debate over antibiotic use in animal agriculture combines elements of science\, ethics\, politics\, and law. Between fifty and eighty percent of all antibiotics sold in the United States are fed to farm animals raised for human consumption––both to promote animal growth and reduce disease in food-producing livestock living in high-density conditions. This agricultural antibiotic use significantly contributes to the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria that affect our ability to treat and prevent human disease\, and serious animal welfare concerns exist regarding the concentrated environments this antibiotic use enables. Considerable social and financial costs weigh on both sides of the issue\, and the legal system is invoked with each new dispute. This symposium will explore the many facets of the debate with presentations by leading legal advocates\, health sciences experts\, and public policy scholars.\n\n

SUMMARY:The Internet of Garbage with Sarah Jeong
DESCRIPTION:With the international attention on the torrent of Twitter threats sent to Caroline Criado-Perez in 2013 (and the later prosecution of some of the people who sent her those threats)\, and national attention on the months-long firestorm associated with #Gamergate\, “harassment” is a word that is bandied around with increasing frequency. As it becomes more and more obvious that women are disparately impacted by harassment on the Internet\, harassment is framed as a civil rights problem\, legal solutions are proposed\, and vitriol is hurled at platforms for failing to protect female users. There is a pervasive feeling that there is a crisis on the Internet that pits the safety of women against the freedom of speech. Yet the Internet has long grappled with what to do when unwanted speech makes it unusable. The history of the Web—from its oldest forgotten communities to the decades of anti-spam technology—can offer a new lens through which to understand online harassment\, along with lessons and caveats.

SUMMARY:Kicked Out of Your Own Company: Part 1 of the INCUBATE Series
DESCRIPTION:Our first event in the INCUBATE series will feature a local entrepreneur\, Yush Gupta\, who believes he was unfairly pushed out of a company he helped found\, and commentary from Goodwin Procter attorneys on how he could have prevented this situation. For those who followed Eduardo Saverin’s lawsuit against Facebook\, Yush finds himself in a similar situation. Yush will discuss\, among other things\, his various business successes and failures and what it is like to be a co-founder and CTO. Yush will conclude with his most recent experience\, where he was cut out of the equity in his company. Attorneys from Goodwin Procter will then respond\, discussing how to best prepare for these situations in advance and what Yush could have done differently. We will also have free time for networking at the end of the event along with free beer and pizza. This promises to be a great opportunity to learn about a very difficult situation that all founders must be conscientious of.
